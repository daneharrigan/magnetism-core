Everything has been updated to run on Rails 3.1. Magnetism can now run
as a stand-alone Rails app or as an engine. Supporting CSS and
JavaScript has been moved to app/assets to take advantage of the asset
pipeline.

I added mattr_accessor :defensio_key to the config/initializers/magnetism.rb
generator file. If this is your first time installing Magnetism you wont see
an problem, but if you are now updating Magnetism you wont see any indicator
of where to add your Defensio key. Add config.defensio_key = 'my-key-here'
and you should be set.

All images, stylesheets and javascript files were copied into the Rails.root/public
directory when you'd run rails g magnetism:install. These files are now kept within
the gem and do not get copied out.

If you're updating your copy of magnetism please delete the Rails.root/public/admin
directory if it exists.
